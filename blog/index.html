                <h1>Money Heist</h1>
                <img src="../image/money heist.jpg" alt="money heist" height="400px" width="100%">
                <p>Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, [la ˈkasa ðe paˈpel], lit. 'The House of Paper') is a Spanish
                    heist crime drama television series created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists
                    led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain,
                    told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The story is told in a
                    real-time-like fashion and relies on an unreliable narrator, flashbacks, time-jumps, and hidden
                    character motivations for complexity.

                    The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original
                    run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix
                    acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and
                    released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second
                    part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased
                    budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4,
                    also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and
                    the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de
                    papel: El Fenómeno). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which was
                    released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively.

                    Similar to Money Heist: The Phenomenon, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast
                    premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin. The series was filmed
                    in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, Italy (Florence),
                    Denmark and in Portugal (Lisbon). A South Korean remake set in an alternate universe, Money Heist:
                    Korea – Joint Economic Area, was released on 24 June 2022, while a direct spin-off, Berlin, with
                    Pedro Alonso, Itziar Ituño, and Najwa Nimri reprising their roles, was released on 29 December 2023,
                    forming a shared universe.[5]

                    The series received several awards including the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series at
                    the 46th International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot,
                    interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian
                    anti-fascist song "Bella ciao", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer
                    hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and
                    one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,[6] having particular resonance with viewers from
                    Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American regions.</p>

                <h1>Stranger Things</h1>
                <img src="../image/drama 2.jpg" alt="stranger things" height="400px" width="100%">
                <p>Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s. The nearby
                    Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department
                    of Energy but also secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human
                    test subjects. They have inadvertently created a portal to an alternate dimension they refer to as
                    the Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in unusual ways.[7][8]

                    The first season begins in November 1983. Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.
                    His mother Joyce, Police Chief Jim Hopper, and a group of volunteers search for him. A young
                    psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes from the laboratory and is found by friends of Will. Eleven
                    befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will.[9]

                    The second season is set eleven months later, in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but he begins
                    having premonitions of the fall of Hawkins caused by a creature in the Upside Down. When it is
                    discovered that Will is still being possessed by an entity from the Upside Down, his friends and
                    family learn that there is a larger threat to their world.[10]

                    The third season is set nine months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration
                    in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, putting
                    the majority of other local stores out of business due to the mall's popularity. Hopper becomes
                    increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship and becomes very protective of his
                    daughter. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory underneath Starcourt seeks to open the
                    gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer uses mind control to make Billy do his
                    bidding.

                    The fourth season is set eight months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have
                    moved to Lenora, California for a fresh start. In California, Eleven struggles with the loss of her
                    powers and being bullied in school. Meanwhile, in Hawkins, a being from the Upside Down—an entity
                    later dubbed Vecna—begins killing the residents of Hawkins, opening new gates between the two worlds
                    in the process. Planning to stop Vecna, Dr. Sam Owens takes Eleven to a facility to help her regain
                    her powers. Simultaneously, Joyce and Murray fly to Russia to rescue Hopper from the Gulag in
                    Kamchatka.</p>

                <h1>Wednesday</h1>
                <img src="../image/drama 3.jpg" alt="wednesday" height="400px" width="100%">
                <p>Wednesday is an American coming-of-age supernatural mystery television series based on the character
                    Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams. Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega
                    as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan,
                    Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and
                    Moosa Mostafa appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the first season were
                    directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive producer. It revolves around Wednesday Addams,
                    who attempts to solve a murder mystery at her new school.

                    Burton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film The Addams Family and was involved with a
                    cancelled stop-motion animated The Addams Family film. In October 2020, he was reported to be
                    helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast in
                    part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had played the titular character in
                    the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel Addams Family Values, was asked by Burton to join the series in a
                    supporting role. Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March 2022.

                    Wednesday premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to
                    predominantly positive reviews from critics, who praised Ortega's performance.[3] Within three weeks
                    of release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series. It received two
                    Golden Globe nominations: Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television
                    Series Musical or Comedy for Ortega. It also won four Primetime Emmy Awards, while receiving
                    nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In
                    January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.</p>
